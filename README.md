This is my roguelike/deckbuilding/snake game.

Thanks to all of these games for inspiration: Snake, Slay the Spire, Slither.io, Enter the Gungeon, One Step from Eden, Peggle, SNKRX, Crypt of the Necrodancer, Super Auto Pets, Unrailed, and many more.

No thanks to League of Legends for being a cesspool of toxicity and frustration, and causing generations of gamers to hemorrhage time and money into a bottomless pit of pain and despair.

You're a snake, and your goal is to eat all of the other delicious animals each level in order to grow big and strong. Crashing into obstacles or yourself will end the game. However, you are what you eat, and eating certain animals will give you special powers. Some of these powers will be passively available, but others will need to be activated by making specific movements. (You don't have arms or legs ^_^) Once you've eaten all of the animals and grown to your maximum size, you win!

The game will be hosted online using Rails, with an instruction and high score page, but the root directory will be focused on the game itself. It will be written in Javascript, and rendered using Canvas.
