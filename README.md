This is my roguelike/deckbuilding/snake game. üêç

You're a sneaky snacking snake, and your goal is to use WASD controls to move around each level, eating all of the other delicious animals in order to grow big and strong. Crashing into obstacles or yourself will end the game, which is harder and harder as you get longer. However, you are what you eat, and eating certain animals will give you special powers. Some of these powers will be passively available, but others will need to be activated by making specific movements. (You don't have arms or legs ^_^) Once you've eaten all of the animals and grown to your maximum size, you win!

As you play through the game, levels will get harder, in the form of obstacles such as water or spikes, and possible moving enemies later on. To handle this, eating certain amounts of certain animals will make your snake stronger. For instance, eating a few fish in the same level will allow your snake to swim through water. Eating even more of the same animals may improve the bonuses even more. Hopefully, different bonuses will encourage different playstyles, and give the game some replayability. Users will be able to login in order to save high scores and possible save their game, but the game will be playable as a guest. 

The game will be hosted online using Rails, with an instruction and high score page, but the root directory will be focused on the game itself. It will be written in Javascript, and rendered using Canvas. I don't foresee any need for backend. 

Thanks to all of these games and their creators for inspiration: Snake, Slither.io, Slay the Spire, One Step from Eden, Peglin, Roundguard, SNKRX, Crypt of the Necrodancer, Super Auto Pets, Unrailed, Enter the Gungeon, and many more.

No thanks to League of Legends for being a cesspool of toxicity and frustration, and causing generations of gamers to hemorrhage time and money into a bottomless pit of pain and despair.
