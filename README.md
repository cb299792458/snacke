You're a sneaky snacking snake, and your goal is to use WASD controls to move around each level, eating all of the other delicious animal snacks in order to grow big and strong. Crashing into obstacles or yourself will end the game, which is harder and harder as you get longer. However, you are what you eat, and eating certain snacks will give you special powers. Some of these powers will be passively available, but others will need to be activated by making specific movements. (You don't have arms or legs üòÖ) Once you've eaten enough snacks and filled your stomach, you win!

As you play through the game, levels will get harder, in the form of obstacles such as water. To handle this, eating certain amounts of certain animals will make your snake stronger. For instance, eating a few fish in the same level will allow your snake to swim through water. 

The game will be hosted online, with highscores saved globally using Firebase. A single html page will store all necessary information.

Thanks to all of these games and their creators for inspiration: Snake, Slither.io, Slay the Spire, One Step from Eden, Peglin, Roundguard, SNKRX, Crypt of the Necrodancer, Super Auto Pets, Unrailed, Enter the Gungeon, and many more.

No thanks to League of Legends for being a cesspool of toxicity and frustration, and causing generations of gamers to hemorrhage time and money into a bottomless pit of pain and despair.
